# Sarcasm-Detector
Sarcasm detection project for CMU 11-777, Multimodal Machine Learning

The data we used is too big to upload here. Check it out [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OXDqYu-rYuTJI0NNl-vVJYMOhIKRfrxn?usp=sharing).
The embeddings were created using the scripts in this repo on the subset of data uploaded in that folder (except for the lnaguage embeddings which were created on the first 1000 samples from the subset).

These scripts need to be run such that the [Twitter Dataset](https://github.com/headacheboy/data-of-multimodal-sarcasm-detection) is cloned in the same parent directory as this repository and the images from that Twitter Dataset are downloaded in a data folder within this repository.
